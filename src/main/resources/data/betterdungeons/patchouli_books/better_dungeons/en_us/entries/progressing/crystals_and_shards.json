Your dungeon level determines the difficulty of the dungeon, as well as the loot that you get. There are many different ways in which you can increase your dungeon levels, which will be shown in this entry."

However, it is important to note that you will get more experience from killing the dungeon boss, rather than escaping back through the portal. This will make you level up passively, but will not be the main source of income for your dungeon experience."

The dinner is so phat, it physically moves the experience bar on your screen, forcing the game to level you up. Eat at your own risk. Only the most brave and herioc dungeoners can handle the magnitude of the $(h)Phat Dinner.$()"
