You can find loot in the chests and your goal is to kill the dungeon boss. In order to do that, you need to find the boss room and unlock it with the $(h)Boss Key$(), which will let you into the boss arena. Once you kill the boss, you can leave."

You can level up by completing dungeons but also by eating $(h)Phat Dinner$(). You can see your dungeon level above your hunger bar. Another thing to note is that you cannot set your spawn in the dungeon, or go back after you have died. Make sure not to run out of time.$(br)$(h)Good luck, adventurer.$()"
